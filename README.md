# Mouse movement Environment (MouseGrid)

<[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maximecb/gym-minigrid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maximecb/gym-minigrid)>

This is a minimalistic environment for simulating human mouse movement, controlled as individual pixel directions (right, down, left, up) or in a continuous fashin with articulated trajectories. 

Requirements:
- Python 3.5+
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI 
- Matplotlib (optional, only needed for display)
